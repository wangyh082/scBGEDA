# Overview

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an increasingly popular technique for transcriptomic analysis of gene expression at the single-cell level. Cell-type clustering is the first crucial task in the analysis of scRNA-seq data to facilitate accurate identification of cell types and to study the characteristics of their transcripts. Recently, several computational models based on a deep autoencoder and the ensemble clustering have been developed to analyze scRNA-seq data. However, current deep autoencoders are not sufficient to learn the latent representations of scRNA-seq data, and obtaining consensus partitions from these feature representations remains under-explored. To address this challenge, we propose a single-cell deep clustering model via a dual denoising autoencoder with bipartite graph ensemble clustering called scBGEDA, to identify specific cell populations in single-cell transcriptome profiles. First, a single-cell dual denoising  autoencoder network is proposed to project the data into a compressed low-dimensional space and that can learn feature representation via explicit modeling of synergistic optimization of ZINB reconstruction loss and denoising reconstruction loss. Then, a bipartite graph ensemble clustering algorithm is designed to exploit the relationships between cells and the learned latent embedded space by means of a graph-based consensus function. Multiple comparison experiments were conducted on fifteen scRNA-seq datasets from different sequencing platforms using a variety of clustering metrics. The experimental results indicated that scBGEDA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on these datasets, and also demonstrated scalability to large scale scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, scBGEDA was able to identify cell-type specific marker genes and provide functional genomic analysis by quantifying the influence of genes on cell clusters, bringing new insights to identify cell types and characterize the scRNA-seq data from different perspectives.

# Installation

1. Requirements:

```
[python 3.6+]
[tensorflow 2.9.1]
[keras 2.9.0]
[numpy 1.21.4]
[jgraph 0.2.1]
[scipy 1.8.1]
[scanpy 1.9.2]
[pathos conda0.2.9]
[tqdm 4.62.1]
[python-dateutil 2.8.2]
```

2. Installation:
2.1 Build from sources
To meet the requirements, we recommend user to use either (1) [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) environment:
```
# Download scBGEDA from GitHub and install all required packages:

git clone https://github.com/wangyh082/scBGEDA.git
cd code
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

```
# To activate environment:

conda activate scBGEDA
```

```
# To exit environment:

conda deactivate
```

# Data availability

The real single-cell RNA-seq datasets and source codes for our analyses are freely available at (https://figshare.com/articles/software/scBGEDA/19657911).

# Usage

The dataset "Adam" is given as an example. 

First, you can run the following code in your command lines:

python SDDA.py --dataname Adam

The parameters including "dataname", "highly_genes", "random_seed", "dims", "alpha", "learning_rate", "batch_size", "pretrain_epoch", "noise_sd", "gpu_option" can be provided as you like in your command lines, such as:

python SDDA.py --dataset Quake_Smart-seq2_Diaphragm --highly_genes 2000 

If the parameter is not set to a given value, then it will use the default setting.

Then you can will obtain ten mat files in ten random seeds. 

Next, you can run the main.m using Matlab to get the clustering result for the dataset "Adam" in your command lines:

matlab main.m --

Finally, you can achieve the median values of ARI and NMI, respectively.
